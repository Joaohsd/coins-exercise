## **Problem: Coins**

## **Requirements**

*   JDK (v17+);
*   Maven (v3.9.5);

## **Build**

The build process needs maven. In order to do that, use the command below:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

## **Run**

In order to run the demo project, just run the command below after Build:

```shell
java -jar target/coins-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## **Notes**

The complexity of this algorithm is so large, because we have 4 for statements. 
The complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^4)** and it is not possible to be executed for large numbers.

I know that it could be improved using **Dynamic Programming** or **Recursive Backtracking** method to solve that. But based on time to solve the algorithm
and questions, I give my best to solve it!
